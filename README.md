As the User:
You will see a home page where you can add any Marvel or DC movie. You will also have the choice to navigate to DC or Marvel movies. This will give you a list of all the movies that are apart of the Universe. Where you can add the movie to your Watch List, you may even delete a movie if you accidently added a movie by accident.

I hope you enjoy it
